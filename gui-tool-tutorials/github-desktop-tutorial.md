# First Contributions - An Introduction to Git
(Cloned from [https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions).

## GitHub Desktop Edition

It's hard. It's always hard the first time you do something. Especially when you are collaborating, making mistakes isn't a comfortable thing. But open source is all about collaboration & working together. We wanted to simplify the way new open-source contributors learn & contribute for the first time.

Reading articles & watching tutorials can help, but what comes better than actually doing the stuff without messing up anything. This project aims at providing guidance & simplifying the way rookies make their first contribution. Remember the more relaxed you are the better you learn. If you are looking for making your first contribution just follow the simple steps below. It will be fun!

If you don't have GitHub Desktop on your machine, [install it](https://desktop.github.com/).


## Fork this repository

Fork this repo by clicking on the fork button on the top right of this page.
This will create a copy of this repository in your account.

## Clone the repository

Now clone this repo to your machine.

IMPORTANT: DO NOT CLONE THE ORIGINAL REPO. Go to your fork and clone it.

To clone the repo, click on "<> Code" and then click on "Open with GitHub Desktop".

A pop up window will open. Click on "Open GitHubDesktop.exe". (If you haven't installed it already - now is the point to do so ...!)

Now you have copied the contents of the first-contributions repository in github to your computer.

## Create a branch

We need to create a new **'branch'**, which is a copy of the repo contents in your account, so you can make changes without changing the main reposity contents until you are happy with the changes. 

Create a branch by clicking on the "Current branch" icon at the top and then click on "New branch":

<img src="../images/newBranch.png" alt="make a branch" />

Name your branch <add-your-name>. For example, "add-james-smith"

<img src="https://firstcontributions.github.io/assets/gui-tool-tutorials/github-desktop-tutorial/dt1-create-branch-name.png" alt="name your branch" />

Click on `Create branch`

## Make necessary changes and commit those changes

Now, go to history tab and open `Contributors.md` file in a text editor by right clicking and open in text editor. Scroll to the bottom of the page and add your name to it, then save the file.

Example: If your name is James Smith, It should look like this.

\[James Smith](https://github.com/jamessmith)

You can see that there are changes to Contributors.md and they have been added to the Github Desktop.

Now commit those changes:

Write the message "Add `<your-name>` to Contributors list" in the _summary_ field.

Replace `<your-name>` with your name.

Click on the button that says `Commit to add-your-name`.

<img src="https://firstcontributions.github.io/assets/gui-tool-tutorials/github-desktop-tutorial/dt1-commit1.png" alt="commit your changes" />

At the bottom, you can see that the commit has been created.
